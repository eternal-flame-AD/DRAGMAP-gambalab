 ** \brief A region along a read used to generate hash keys to query the reference
 ** hashtable
 **
 ** Note that the Seed only encapsulates the concept of a region along the read
 ** in a minimalistic way. Particularly, the concepts of orientation and of seed
 ** extension are mostly left outside of this class. The orientation is supported
 ** in the sense that the Seed methods enable generating the sequence of bases both
 ** in the forward and in the reverse direction. Similarly, seed extensions are
 ** supported in the sense that the Seed methods enable generating the sequences
 ** of bases for any extension wing that the user might need. However, it is the
 ** responsibility of the client code to manage the direction and extension sizes.
